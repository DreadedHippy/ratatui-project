# 🏦TUI Banking System
This is a Terminal-User-Interface(TUI) based banking system written with the Rust programming language and the [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/) library. Originally a [C++ project I found online](https://t4tutorials.com/bank-management-system-project-in-c/), I decided to rewrite it in Rust, and add cool new features.

## 📌Features
- Create a user
- Create a bank account
- Check bank account balances
- Deposit into a bank account
- Withdraw from a bank account
- Update a bank account number
- Close a bank account.

## 💫 How to try it out
To run the program, simply download the exe file in the "release" section.

## ✨Final notes
The admin password is "**admin123**"

Thank you for checking it out. Have fun
